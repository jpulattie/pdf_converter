README

This program converts pdf files to png files, places the png files into a pictures folder, and deletes 
the original pdf. The program will not convert other file types and will alert the user that the file 
is not a pdf.

This program was built to take a batch of client Quotes and convert them from pdf to a picture in order
to make texting the quote to clients easier.  Because of the intended use of this program, there are lines
of code that clean up the file name prior to saving the png.
